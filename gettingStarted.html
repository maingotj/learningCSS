                Unlike many outdoor sports, getting started with <a href="index.html">bouldering is surprisingly simple.</a> All you need are some climbing shoes, chalk, and a positive attitude—most gyms even rent the equipment for your first sessions. <strong>No prior experience or complex gear required!</strong>
            </p>
